# Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge

[The 21-Day Coding Challenge](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/)

>Welcome to the Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge! Over the next 21 days you’ll be travelling aboard the exploratory vessel ISS Lighthouse, on a mission to explore the galaxy.
>
>Just as you depart the solar system, a gigantic space bug knocks you off course! As the ISS Lighthouse captain, you’ll need to solve daily coding challenges to repair the ship and continue on your mission.

This repository is a record of the 2019 21DCC's challenges, and their solutions.

## Global Objects

There are a few objects you're going to be working with and their initial values. This is only a subset of them, to give you a idea of what they look like. You can see below that they're all messed up:

```javascript
var navigation = {
  x: -2,
  y: "Banana",
  z: "Beep",
  speed: "raaaaid"
};

var ship = {
  powerOn: false,
  modules: [],
  antenna: {
    active: false
  }
};

var radio = {
  frequency: "Kenneth",
  message: "Bugs are cool.",
  beacon: false
};
```

## About the 21DCC

From the 21DCC FAQ:

>### What Is The 21-Day Coding Challenge?
>
>We've all been there, promising yourself this will be the year you commit to a daily habit that leads to a better you - this time you're really going to learn another language, exercise every day, read a book per week, build up your coding skills. The pesky problem with new habits is that they’re difficult to develop, and finding time to practice something every day can seem impossible amidst many other commitments.
>
>When it comes to coding, perhaps you've already tried to learn on your own. Maybe you started an online tutorial and stopped the lessons after a few days, only to return a few weeks later and find you had forgotten everything you learned! To truly gain a new skill, you need to dive in and give your brain a chance to build muscle memory. To make real progress, you need to commit to practice coding every day.
>
>That’s why Lighthouse Labs is challenging you, regardless of your coding experience, to spend 15-30 minutes a day learning Javascript, the most widely used coding language in the world. The 21-Day Coding Challenge is an opportunity to learn how to code in a fun, free, and social way for a chance to win amazing prizes.
>
>### How Does the Challenge Work?
>
>Starting May 1st, you’ll have 21 days to build a coding habit with a daily Javascript coding challenge. The challenges take just 15-30 minutes a day, and they’re all set in a fun space theme; you’ll spend 21 days as captain of the ISS Lighthouse, completing Javascript challenges to repair your spaceship!
>
>While we encourage you to complete a challenge a day to really build a habit, you can catch up if you miss a day here and there - a new challenge is released daily, and they will be available until May 21! From your profile, you will have access to a forum to help answer your questions and you will receive daily hints to help you complete your coding challenge.
