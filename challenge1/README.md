## Challenge #1
"POWER OFF!" quacks LARRY. That sounds like a big problem! You should probably get the power back on, otherwise things are not going to go very well for you in the depths of uncharted space! Unfortunately, the manual for your ship is hard to read in the dark.

"Ship's powerOn property set to false!" LARRY exclaims. "MUST CHANGE VALUE! QUACK!" Okay, that sounds pretty serious. Fortunately, you remember from orientation that there are things called "properties" in JavaScript. You access properties using the '.' operator. With just the light from LARRY's terminal, you need to write a function called powerOn() which will change the 'powerOn' property of the 'ship' object. If that's set to 'false', changing it to 'true' should get things going.

**Hint:** LARRY loudly quacks out, "Set values in JavaScript using a single equals sign."
